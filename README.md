# The Hogwarts-Challenge



## Description
Web application built in Node.js. It uses an API to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) MongoDB database items.

The application allows users to register, and to be assigned to a random Hogwarts house.
Once registered, users can access the lobby of their House, where they can discuss with people of their House through a chat.

## Librairies used

- Express
- Bcrypt
- Mongoose
- Path
- Dotenv

## Pain points
The frontend is very ugly but if you click buttons, it does things...

Securization : API access isn't restricted. JWT's aren't used for this application.
